# BlockStarter
Blockchain Application with Ethereum and Next.js.In this application I tried to solve the some issue with KickStarter using the Blockchain 
concept.Here person with new startup idea can create project for crowd funding,and people can donate to that project with some "Ether" and become approver.
Owner can only spend the money if theire request get 51% of approvers,so that people who donated to project can also have some rights towards spending money.In this 
way we can minimize some threads with fake project for crowd funding
